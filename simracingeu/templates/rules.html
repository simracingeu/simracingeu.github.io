        <br>
        <strong>Overtaking</strong>
        <br>
        <strong>Non-lapped drivers</strong>
        <br>

        Overtaking is permitted on either side of the track, provided it does not interfere with the "racing line" of
        side-by-side drivers.

        Any driver who hits another during an overtake may be investigated. The severity of the penalty will depend on
        the collision‚Äôs speed differential, consequences for the defending driver, impact on other drivers, and position
        yielding.

        Minimal/moderate contact is allowed during position battles if it does not cause excessive trajectory changes or
        spins/offs.

        When battling into a braking zone, drivers must maintain a safe distance to avoid collisions from early braking.
        <br>
        <strong>Multiple cars in a braking zone:</strong>
        If multiple cars enter a braking zone side-by-side, each driver must respect their "natural lane." Example:

        If two defending drivers begin braking ahead, an attacking driver behind cannot brake later, switch lanes, and
        claim a preferred lane.

        Natural lane* refers to the lane formed between two or more cars during braking and throughout the corner.

        Neither attacker nor defender may force a driver against the track‚Äôs edges. Each driver must allow sporting
        battles.
        <br>
        <strong>Gaining position:</strong>
        A driver is considered to have gained position (inside/outside) only when their car fully overtakes the
        defender. Use Helicorsa and mirrors to avoid side collisions.
        <br>
        <strong>Conditions for overtaking at the start of a curve (braking zone):</strong>

        Both cars arrive at similar speed/position, with the attacker at least 25% alongside the defender.

        The attacker‚Äôs trajectory does not obstruct the defender‚Äôs natural lane.

        If these conditions are not met, the attacker must abort the overtake and allow the defender to take their line.

        Examples:
        <br>
        <strong>Non-aligned drivers:</strong>
        <br>
        <img src="{% static 'img/notpara1.png' %}" style="width: 400px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
        <br>
        The attacker fails to reach 25% alongside in the braking zone (red zone). The defender may take any line, and
        the attacker must adjust speed.
        <br>
        <strong>Aligned drivers:</strong>
        <br>
    <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 15px;">
        <img src="{% static 'img/notpara21.png' %}" style="width: 400px; margin-right: 10px; display: inline-block;">
        <img src="{% static 'img/notpara22.png' %}" style="width: 400px; margin-left: 10px; display: inline-block;">
    </div>
    <br>
    {% trans "Both cases show aligned cars in the braking zone. Lane invasion is prohibited." %}
    <br>
    <strong>Overtaking in the braking zone:</strong>
    <br>
    {% trans "A full overtake in the braking zone is permissible if the attacker fully passes the defender. If still aligned
    by the end of the braking zone, the defender‚Äôs position must be respected." %}
    <br>
    <strong>Distance from another driver</strong>
    <br>

    When battling (or lapping), drivers must leave sufficient space. Abruptly closing space is classified as
    Moderate.
    <br>
    <strong>Lapped drivers:</strong>
    <br>

    Blue flag rules apply. Lapped drivers must maintain a predictable line and facilitate overtaking by lifting off
    the throttle.

    Lapped drivers must yield within 4 corners.

    <br>
    <strong>Direction changes</strong>
    <br>

    {% trans "When defending on a straight, a driver may make one directional change. Example:"

    "After a right-hand corner, a defender on the left may move right once, then return left."

    "Two or more direction changes (e.g., zig-zag) are prohibited and classified as Moderate." %}
    <img src="{% static 'img/doble_cambio.png' %}" style="width: 400px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">

    <br>
    <strong>Recovery after off-track:</strong>
    <br>
    {% trans "A driver who partially leaves the track (3 wheels out) must yield to on-track drivers and avoid
    collisions/obstruction. Failure to do so is Moderate." %}
    <br>
    <strong>Ballast</strong>
    <br>
    {% trans "Ballast is used to balance performance. If a car demonstrates excessive superiority, organizers may apply
    ballast (with prior notice)." %}
    <br>

    <strong>Absences</strong>
    <br>
    {% trans "Drivers are expected to adhere to the calendar. Three unjustified absences in a championship may result in
    exclusion. Events may be canceled if >90% of drivers are absent." %}
    <br>

    <strong>Admission</strong>
    <br>
    {% trans "New drivers may join until 50% of the championship has passed. After that, entries close unless otherwise
    specified." %}
    <br>

    <strong>Protests</strong>
    <br>
    {% trans "Protests must be emailed to simracingeurope@gmail.com. Public complaints against organizers or SimRacingEU are
    prohibited." %}
    <br>

    <strong>Loss of car control</strong>
    <br>
    {% trans "A driver who loses control must stop immediately. Partial off-track incidents causing drastic speed
    loss/direction changes may be penalized." %}
    <br>

    <strong>Pit stops</strong>
    <br>
    {% trans "Drivers must not cross the pit lane white line. RealPenalty enforces penalties (e.g., drive-through)." %}
    <br>
    <strong>Parallel vehicles</strong>
    <br>
    {% trans "Vehicles are parallel if any part overlaps. Each driver must stay in their 'imaginary lane,' even in multi-car
    scenarios." %}
    <br>
    <strong>Damage</strong>
    <br>
    {% trans "If a car is immobilized, use the 'back to pits' button. Exploiting this for advantage is Severe." %}
    <br>
    <strong>Exploits</strong>
    <br>
    {% trans "Deliberate track cuts, wall-riding, or using invalid laps for advantage are Severe. Examples:"

    "Skipping chicanes."

    "Bouncing off walls for speed."

    "Modifying CSP settings to gain an advantage in night championships." %}
    <br>
    <strong>Runoff areas</strong>
    <br>
    {% trans "Runoff use must avoid gaining advantage. Repeating this may be Moderate/Severe." %}
    <br>
    <strong>Changes</strong>
    <br>
    {% trans "This regulation is subject to updates."

    "Version numbers reflect revisions."
